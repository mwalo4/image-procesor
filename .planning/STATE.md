## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- rembg is a black-box AI — cannot fix the model itself, must correct its output in post-processing
- Flood-fill bleeding is the root cause of white product loss in non-AI mode

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No automated tests exist; regression validation in Phase 3 must be done manually with representative images
- Gradient edge barrier was tried before and only partially helped — Phase 1 approach must go further
